Recurrence
1. Express everything in terms of index
2. Try all possible ways
3. Find max length or count, etc
4. Base case - Think of the smallest valid input (IMPORTANT)

Recursion to Memoization :
1. declare dp array - 1D or 2D depends on the number of changing parameters.
2. size of dp array depends on the changing parameters - Eg: 2 changes -> 2D dp -> size should be enough to accomodate the changing params.
        If n is size of array and that is the only changing param, then it will be 1D dp array - size dp[n+1] - as we need 
        to store values till n. 
3. if(dp[ind] != -1) return dp[ind]; // if dp[ind] has been computed already, return the same
4. assign dp[ind] to the result and return [Eg: return dp[ind] = maxLen]

Tabulation :
1. Handle base case
2. Express the changing parameters as loop
        - opposite manner (make sure to follow coordinate shift)
4. Copy the recurrence and make sure to follow coordinate shift

BASE CASE : 
        whenever recursion is started from n-1, our base case will always be for index 0 - tabulation from 0 to n-1
        whenever recursion is started from 0, our base case will always be for index n - tabulation from n-1 to 0
