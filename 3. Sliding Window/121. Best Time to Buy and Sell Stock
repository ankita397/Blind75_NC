//INTUITION : If we wanna sell on i'th day, then we have to buy on the minimum price from day 0 to i-1. 
//So, we need to keep track of the minimum price.

//TC = O(n), SC = O(1)
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        int minimum = prices[0];//we need to keep track of the minimum price so say we buy at 
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            //find the profit
            int profit = prices[i] - minimum;
            //find the maximun profit
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit,profit);
            //re-assign mini for next iteration
            minimum = Math.min(minimum, prices[i]);
        }
