//Approach - Cycle Detection - Topological sort (BFS)

Can use DFS Cycle detection as well - but we cannot find the order of the courses taken - only isCycle can be checked

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u-v, 
vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Topo sort - 1 -> 0 (vertex 1 should come before vertex 0) => no cycle

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Topo sort - 1 -> 0 (vertex 1 should come before vertex 0) 
           0 -> 1 (vertex 0 should come before vertex 1)  ====> Cycle

class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        // numCourses = total number of courses (vertices)
        // prerequisites[] = array of course pairs where [a, b] means "course a depends on course b"
        //Eg : prerequisites =  [[1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 2]] , numCourses = 4

        // Step 1: Initialize the adjacency list to represent the graph
        List<List<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Create an empty adjacency list for each course
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }

        //After above step - adj = [[], [], [], []]

        // Step 2: Populate the adjacency list based on the given prerequisites
        // Each course `b` has a directed edge to course `a` because `a` depends on `b`
        for (int i = 0; i < prerequisites.length; i++) {
            int course = prerequisites[i][0];
            int prerequisite = prerequisites[i][1];
            adj.get(prerequisite).add(course);
        }

        //After above step adj = [[1], [2], [3], []]

        // Step 3: Create the indegree array to track the number of prerequisites (incoming edges) for each course
        int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];
        
        // Traverse the adjacency list to populate the indegree array
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            for (int course : adj.get(i)) {
                indegree[course]++;  // Increment indegree for each course that depends on course i
            }
        }
        //After above step - indegree = [0, 0, 0, 0] --> indegree = [0, 1, 1, 1]

        // Step 4: Initialize a queue to perform a topological sort (Kahn's algorithm)
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        
        // Add all courses with no prerequisites (indegree 0) to the queue
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                q.add(i);
            }
        }
        //After above step - q = [0]
        
        // Step 5: Perform topological sort by processing the courses in the queue
        List<Integer> topoList = new ArrayList<Integer>();  // List to store the topological order
        
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int course = q.poll();  // Take the course with no prerequisites (indegree 0)
            topoList.add(course);   // Add it to the topological order
            
            // Decrease the indegree of all courses that depend on the current course
            for (int dependentCourse : adj.get(course)) {
                indegree[dependentCourse]--;  // One less prerequisite for the dependent course
                
                // If a dependent course now has no prerequisites (indegree 0), add it to the queue
                if (indegree[dependentCourse] == 0) {
                    q.add(dependentCourse);
                }
            }
        }

        //Queue after iteration 1: [1]
        //topoList: [0]
        //Queue after iteration 2: [2]
        //topoList: [0, 1]
        //Queue after iteration 3: [3]
        //topoList: [0, 1, 2]
        //Queue after iteration 4: []
        //topoList: [0, 1, 2, 3]


        // Step 6: Check if all courses have been processed (i.e., if a valid topological order exists)
        // If we have processed exactly `numCourses`, it means there is no cycle and we can finish all courses
        return topoList.size() == numCourses;
    }
}


Step 5:

Queue: [0]

Now the algorithm proceeds to process the courses in the queue.

Iteration 1:
Queue: [0]
Dequeue Course 0.
Add Course 0 to topoList: [0].
Course 0 has a dependent course: Course 1. Decrease the indegree of Course 1 to 0.
Since Course 1 now has an indegree of 0, add it to the queue.
Queue after iteration 1: [1]

Iteration 2:
Queue: [1]
Dequeue Course 1.
Add Course 1 to topoList: [0, 1].
Course 1 has a dependent course: Course 2. Decrease the indegree of Course 2 to 0.
Since Course 2 now has an indegree of 0, add it to the queue.
Queue after iteration 2: [2]

Iteration 3:
Queue: [2]
Dequeue Course 2.
Add Course 2 to topoList: [0, 1, 2].
Course 2 has a dependent course: Course 3. Decrease the indegree of Course 3 to 0.
Since Course 3 now has an indegree of 0, add it to the queue.
Queue after iteration 3: [3]

Iteration 4:
Queue: [3]
Dequeue Course 3.
Add Course 3 to topoList: [0, 1, 2, 3].
Course 3 has no dependents.
Queue after iteration 4: []
